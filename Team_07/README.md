## Sprint Review
#### What did we do?
- Fixed existing bugs from Sprint 1
- Cleared the Product Backlog

#### What could be better?
- Time management, along with effective planning & estimation.

#### What we will do?
- Create next Sprint Backlog
- Fix existing bugs

## Sprint Retrospective

#### What did we do well?
- GUI looks pretty good
- Code clean up after each major task
- Sprint 1 pending tasks are completed

#### What should we have done better?
- Could have switched from using JPanels (for shape) to paintComponent sooner
- Lack of planning lead to some rework during the sprint
- Knowledge acquisition's estimation

#### What should we start doing?
- Assigning related user stories to same person
- Assigning user stories depending on the expertise of the person
- Better estimation for each task

#### What should we stop doing?
- Hurrying up to code without proper planning and estimation

#### What should we keep doing? 
- Code clean up and unit testing after each major task
